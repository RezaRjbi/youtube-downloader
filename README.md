aparat and youtube downloder 

pass a [aparat](https://www.aparat.com/) video page link to 
aparat-dl fucntion as an argument and it will download 
lowest the quality possible.

and also you can pass a [youtube](https://youtube.com) video page link
and quality if you want(e.g 144p,360p and etc) and will download the video
as an argument (default quality is 144p) and it will download the video as fast as possible

<strong>Note: all arguments must be string object</strong>

in new version you can run this project and use it as an telegram
api bot. in order to that just put all files in same directory and just run bot.py directly.

good luck.
